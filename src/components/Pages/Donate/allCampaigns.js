I decided to work and fight to be able to have what I do starting over again on the right path. I have a disability in one leg and have always had a motorcycle that I use to support my family. In January someone stole it from me and I was left without any way of making money to support my family. We spent many nights going to bed hungry for up to two days at a time because I didn’t have food or money to feed them. I had good people that gave me a hand with the food, but what I really want is to work and keep fighting for my family. God watches over me and never abandons me. A few days ago a friend gifted me a new motorcycle that was his, but the papers were lost and he gave it to me so that I could work and help my family, but right now I haven’t been able to work because I don’t have the money to get new papers for the motorcycle or to buy oil and have it serviced so that it can run. I’m asking you to give me a hand so I can work and keep fighting for the beautiful family that father God has given me. With my motorcycle I can help a lot. I can help my daughters and drive them to their classes at college. I ask you with all my heart and promise that one day in life before I leave this world I will be so grateful to all of you. I’m hoping for your support for this great man that at one time made mistakes and committed a crime and paid for it in jail, but now is better, changed and improved, doing everything right that he can.",
                    "When I was little I lived with my mother, where the only thing I received was her abuse and the abuse of my father. They hit me a lot and treated me very badly. I watched how my father hit my mother and I without being able to do anything because I was little. The abuse was so bad from my parents that at six years old I went to live with my grandmother who loved me so much. She treated me so well. She helped me a lot and I started to study. I always wanted to be a merchant marine so I could travel and see the world. I kept going and behaved myself but at fourteen my grandmother passed away and my life fell apart. I was left alone without anyone’s help. At fourteen I entered the world of crime and at almost fifteen I killed my first man. At almost sixteen I killed the other. From there I started my life in the world of crime. It was so bad that when I came of age I was locked up twice in the jail Las Flores de Catia. It was a very dangerous jail, and there I got used to crime and kept getting deeper into that world. It was so bad that in the 90’s I was the second most wanted man in Venezuela. I was in all the newspapers and on TV. The police chief looking for me was named Iván Simonovis and he brought me to justice and I was sentenced to 13 years in prison where I went through eight jails throughout the country. In jail people still respected me and I was in the leadership of a prison gang. I continued to do bad things until one day I found God and he helped me get out of that life. My mother, my stepfather, my wife and my family supported me and visited me in all the jails that I went to. I always had the support of my family in that monster of cement where I learned evil but also learned good things. One night I decided to leave that world in which I was buried. I wanted to leave jail alive and achieved that thanks to God. I got out on the 16th of September, the day of Our Lady of Mercy, and also my wife Yamilet Zapata’s birthday. Finally I escaped that labyrinth where men feed themselves with the blood of living beings. Thanks to God I left that jail with my life.",
                    "After getting out of jail on September 16th, I arrived at my new home and started a new life. I left the world of drugs where I was buried for years. I’ve been out of the world of drugs and crime for 17 years. I started to work and get ahead to give a good life and education to my two daughters. I know that I was a bad person, but I want my daughters to be different than their father; educated and prepared women. Today I feel very blessed by God because my daughter, at 17 years old, has started to study at the Central University of Venezuela because she is a very good student. My younger daughter is 16 and in her senior year of high school. She graduates this year and is a very good student. My daughters have gotten ahead. I have taught them the right values that no one ever taught me. I am very proud of my family, of my daughters and my wife. I am a changed and tenacious man; I was able to get ahead and feel that I’m doing very well. I feel very good right now without being a criminal and without taking drugs: I feel very thankful to God and my family for supporting me all these years that I was buried in the world of crime. Here you have a new Vladimir, improved and moving forward. Many thanks to those who have supported me and those who have believed in my rehabilitation.",
                    "At 46 years old I feel very good because these days I work for the rights of those deprived of their freedom. Now I help people that find themselves in that world. It is never too late. A few months ago I applied for a program online to get my high school diploma and was selected. God always gives good opportunities. I will keep fighting and growing each day. A big hug with all my heart to all of you for believing in me and my family. God bless you."
